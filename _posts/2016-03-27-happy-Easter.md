Today was a great day. I had uninterrupted and *complete* time with my family all day long, and then we went to Easter dinner with extended family. I don't have anything in the idea-hopper that feels worthy of capping off today, so I won't try.

I know many, or most of you don't believe the same things I do, but I hope you were able to be with family or friends today, regardless. I always intellectually understand how blessed (or lucky, if you like) I am. Sometimes, however, I can also really *feel* it. 

Life is good here, and I hope it is for you too. Feel free to [email me](mailto:me@potatowire.com) if you're not okay, and you want to talk about it.

Happy Easter.
