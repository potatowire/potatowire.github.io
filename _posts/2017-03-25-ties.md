I've decided what my [first experiment][1] in translated fiction will be: [*Ties*][2] by [Domenico Starnone][3]. 

[Tyler Cowen called it][4] the first fiction must-read of the year, and that's good enough me. As a bonus, it's translated by [Jhumpa Lahiri][5], whose [Conversation with Tyler][6] I greatly enjoyed.

To further the experiment, I'll start a book club Slack if at least 10 of you Grainers are interested. It's a short book, so probably a good place to start. [Send an email][7] if you want to join me.
