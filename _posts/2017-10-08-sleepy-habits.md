In what accidentally became [a tradition][1], I will again set a goal for this week.

Learning [a lesson][2], for once, I will work on just one thing: I will not snooze my alarms this week. It is, sadly, something I thought I'd [already][3][^1] fixed. Most of the <strike>conventional</strike> internet wisdom on forming habits is that it takes only 21 days to form a habit. This is largely because the studies out there *appear* to bear this out, but this timeframe really only applies to easy habits. In reality, the time required to cement a new habit varies wildly based on the complexity of the task, degree of difficulty, internal motivation, etc. 

For my part, I now consider a habit truly formed when it has been in place for 18 months.[^2] Which is an elaborate way of saying I canâ€™t think of a new habit I've ever permanently set. 

Back to not snoozing my alarm. I thought I had this one beat, but in hindsight, I was winning during an easier time. A time when I was temporarily living apart from my family, between sets of military orders. When things returned to normal, I went back to the habit of a lifetime by snoozing my alarm nearly every day.

Now, however, the goal is *one* simple thing for *one* single week. I can do that. I will never be perfect, but I will be a little [better][4].

[^1]:	Apparently this was also during my perscriptive phase. In one of my various reboots, I shifted to more of a team-like tone, since I must've finally noticed I don't have everything figured out. We're all in this together.

[^2]:	This is the worst-case extreme in the studies I've seen.
