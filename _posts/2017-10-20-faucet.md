“Start writing, no matter what. The water does not flow until the faucet is turned on.”

-Louis L'Amour

Fatigue paired with nightly writing continues to be a challenge. I am an all-or-nothing person though. I know from bitter experience that I will either write every day or not at all.  I can’t wait for inspiration. I need to write _into_ inspiration. 

Today, I got an email from my friend [Carl][1], and he provided me some much-needed encouragement. This bit of light will sustain me for a very long time. 

Do you, dear reader, also write? Writing is much easier when you know someone is reading. If you send me a link to your work, I will be your reader. 

We small-timers need to stick together.
