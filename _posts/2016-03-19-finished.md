Interwoven through many posts here is a common thread that I am fascinated by many things. In some ways, I think it is one of my biggest strengths, but it has one serious side effect. I have a lot of trouble finishing what I start.

This is not just a matter of failed projects. Businesses declare bankruptcy. [Big ideas](https://support.google.com/answer/1083134?hl=en) are sunsetted. [Unsuccessful car models](http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a6357/bob-lutz-tells-the-inside-story-of-the-pontiac-aztek-debacle/) are discontinued. Failure *is* an ending  My projects don't fail, they are just forgotten. Just about every time this happens because something else has grabbed my attention. 

I try to manage my split attention with what I call "seasons of obsession." The idea here is that I permit myself only one side project at a time for three months, the length of a season. I think I first got this idea from Stephen King's [rules for writing](http://www.openculture.com/2014/03/stephen-kings-top-20-rules-for-writers.html) (rule 10), but I'm not sure. If I have a good, new idea or come across new information about a project not in season, I put it in [Trello](https://trello.com/) and move on.

I know this is a good plan, but I still fail to finish things. I half-know Javascript. I've designed most of my own custom keyboard. I am slightly better than worst-ever on guitar. The list goes on and on. I *am* good at buying stuff for new hobbies, but that's a topic for another day.

So where does this leave me? I'm not sure, but I'll start by finishing as many things as I can. I'll finish all the books I've begun (even [*Thinking, Fast and Slow*](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555), and I'll finish all the shows I watch (I only have two episodes of [Daredevil](http://with.thegra.in/tgif-4) left).

I'll also keep writing daily here. Even when I don't have answers, writing things out orders my thoughts. I just don't know how I'll know when the blog is finished...
