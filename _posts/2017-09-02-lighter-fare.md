Seems to me, the weekend should be a time for lighter fare, and a break from the [current series ][1].

One big problem with this idea is that I don’t really have a good alternative post for today . I considered a good anecdote from [Richard Feynman][2]. I considered a good [Scrubs][3] clip. I considered some podcast recommendations. In the end, nothing seemed to fit the bill.

I guess I’ll just say that lighter, off-topic fare will be my plan for weekends and make sure to do better in future.

Please consider signing up for [my email list][4]. I haven’t yet sent out anything, but I hope to one day have a weekly newsletter of some sort. In the meantime, it’s the really the only way for me to know you’re reading, given my weak (non-existent) understanding of analytics these days.
