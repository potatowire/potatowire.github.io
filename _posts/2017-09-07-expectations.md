Unfair expectations are all too often the source of resentment in our daily lives.

We give a friend a wonderful gift, but they give us a weak smile and a halfhearted thank you. We help someone out of a jam, but a week later they're badmouthing us to coworkers. We dedicate our lives to raising our children, but they tell their teacher daddy drinks too much.[^1]

At times like this, it is useful to remember the words of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius: “I am going to meet people today who talk too much—people who are selfish, egotistical, ungrateful. But I won’t be surprised or disturbed, for I couldn’t imagine a world without such people.”[^2]

Put another way: people suck, and that’s okay.
