I've been thinking all day about what to write today. This is normal, and I usually work through what's on my mind during [downtime](http://with.thegra.in/embrace-boredom). The upshot of this is I usually sit down at night knowing what I want to say.

I had many ideas, but they were fleeting. I started many posts, but I could not finish them.

I got nothing.

This blog is really just a more public version of [my notebook](http://with.thegra.in/daily-logging), with each post being the most fully-formed of all my day's thoughts. 

They aren't all winners.
