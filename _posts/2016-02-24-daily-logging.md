I am not much for journaling. I've always liked the idea of it, and I have tried multiple times to pick up the habit. I usually begin with a fancy notebook. In fact, the idea probably first took on some romanticism for me when I first saw a [Moleskines](http://www.moleskine.com/Products-portlet/image?id=668) notebook in a [Waldenbooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldenbooks) display (hopefully some of you remember Waldenbooks...or even bookstores at all). 

This was the late nineties and they were brand new, advertising themselves as being the the ["legendary notebook" of Hemingway](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2012/jun/19/joy-moleskine-notebooks). Hey I *read* all the time, maybe I can be a great author too! And this notebook will be the start! Well, I couldn't afford a Moleskine, but I did grab the closest thing I could find at home and began journalling right away. 

I made it one day. 

Always the optimist, I tried again many times in the intervening years. In my basement recently, I even found a nice sewn-binding notebook from my college years. It had only a single entry in it, and that entry was about how this would be the time journaling would stick.

When I began my [journey of self-improvement](http://with.thegra.in/with-the-grain), I decided I needed to keep better track of the things I was reading. I didn't want to take notes per se, just capture big points so I could trace my learning process someday in the future. Instead of getting a fancy notebook I would be afraid to write in, however, I grabbed a Doane [Utility Notebook](http://www.doanepaper.com/products/utility-notebook-large-pack-of-3) that was handy (I've been a [grid+lines](http://www.doanepaper.com/story/) convert for a very long time) and started writing a few words about what I was reading that day. 

Soon, I was also adding brief summaries of my days. Then I was capturing ideas and even, perish the thought, writing about my feelings. Without noticing it, I had finally picked up journaling. By starting small, I built up a habit that was easy to maintain, and now I find I really like getting things out of my head and onto paper.

It looks like I will never be a great author, but maybe I can someday be a really good journaler, like JD.
