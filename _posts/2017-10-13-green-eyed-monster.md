One of the dangers of reading a lot is that it is easy to find people who are better than you.

“Sure,” I  think, “this great work, but it’s a book. Books are special. Books are magic” Except I had the misfortune of hearing about [James Clear][1] in a book I read recently. He has published on his site every Tuesday and Thursday for nearly forever, and his stuff is very good. It's very good, and it makes me feel bad about myself.

Seriously, read his [most recent post][2]. It’s got everything I like: Feynman, science metacognition, *plus* nice pictures. Why do I bother?

Now, he doesn’t seem to have written anything recently. Maybe his work is falling off? Nope. I’m pretty sure it’s just because he’s finishing a book. The jerk.
