For reasons I won’t go into, my [money pressure][1] was increased today.

This naturally caused me to worry, which is ironic[^1], given my [current series][2]. In order to pull out of a worry spiral, I took action based on my previous reading of [_How to Stop Worrying_][3]. I mean that literally. I took action. 

In some ways, it doesn’t matter what the action was, but it certainly helps if it moves the ball forward. In this case, I listed for sale a bunch of excess stuff I shouldn’t have bought in the first place. I can’t go back in time and be less of an dummy, but I can avoid the *sunk cost fallacy* by clawing back some money now.

Today’s selling process was tedious and consumed most of my day. This is much of the point: it’s hard to dwell on worry when you’re busy. A somewhat less ideal consequence of my being busy is that I didn’t allow time enough to finish the reading for today's post. For now, I will just have to leave you with this foreshadowing of a later, more in-depth post.

If you’re battling worry now, [stay tuned][4]. In the meantime, get busy doing something, anything.
