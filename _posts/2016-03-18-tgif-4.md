With an [Apple event](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/march-2016/) coming up on Monday, a Tgif of Tim Cook dancing seems appropriate.

Alright, I'm going to go [binge watch](https://twitter.com/potatowire/status/710570112349155328) Daredevil season two on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80018294) now.

Enjoy your weekend.
