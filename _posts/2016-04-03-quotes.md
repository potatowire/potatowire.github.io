Since I'm traveling again today, I figured I would use Sunday as a quote day again. The problem is quotes are a pain in the neck.

If I am going to post something here, I want to be at least pretty sure who really said it and that it was an original idea. Instead, I seem to really like quotes with unclear or conflicting origins.

So, I quit. I will instead post quotes sporadically, and they will often be useless, like this one from Schmidt on [New Girl](https://g.co/kgs/emM8s):
