“I've had a lot of worries in my life, most of which never happened.”

Mark Twain

Worry seems to me one of the most wasteful emotions that regularly afflicts us. Knowing the futility does not make it any easier to move on to more useful pursuits, however. That being said, there are a number of practical techniques and mindsets which can help, and to that end, I am going to begin a series on worry tomorrow. 

The main source for this series is [_How to Stop Worrying and Start Living_][1][^1] by Dale Carnegie, and I encourage you to read along with me.
