Why do today what can be put off till tomorrow? Not words to live by, but words we all too often *do* live by. I always felt more afflicted by this character flaw than friends of mine were, but I've only ever known a few people who seemed immune.

I spent most of my life assuming I was just lazy, but then I heard an almost offhand comment about procrastination often being tied to anxiety. I think it was during an interview of [Charles Duhigg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Duhigg), probably best known for his book [The Power of Habit](http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business/dp/081298160X), but I'm not sure. This apprehension could be due to fear of an outcome, of failure, or from uncertainty stemming from not quite knowing how to accomplish a task. 

This made a lot of sense to me, and it seem to fit well with the facts in my life, but while I felt better about myself, I didn't really *get* better about avoiding procrastination. This truth did hover around in the back of my head though, and I recently made a breakthrough of sorts. 

I set for myself a simple rule to stop what I was doing any time I felt the desire to put something off and immediately work to identify the *specific* source of the problem. There's no need to do anything about fixing this problem; I just need to identify and capture it. Nine times out of ten, however, I decide to take action anyway.

This probably sounds too simple, but I hope you try it out. You can even wait till tomorrow, if you want.
