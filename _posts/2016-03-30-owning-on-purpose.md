I have a very simple mindset about possessions. Everything I own should be owned on purpose. I shouldn't ever open a drawer and be surprised by something in it. I shouldn't look around and see the accidental accumulation of years. Yes, my philosophy is simple, and it's one I've had for years. Enacting it is hard, and I am my own worst enemy.

I alluded to clutter [recently](http://with.thegra.in/what-falls-out), but this is something I struggle with, by nature. Part of the problem is that I am very sentimental. I don't know why this is so, but I have to make myself toss out anything I have associated with a good memory. I have a lot of good memories. 

I also hate waste, and I have trouble getting rid of something that still has value. Typically, it isn't even real value, and resale would be futile. It just may come in handy some day. You never know. I'd hate to have to repurchase this someday, so I'll just put it over there for now.

The problem with this logic is that it costs something to *keep* maybe-I'll-need-this-someday items, too. This cost is physical--I keep too much, so I need plastic bins, shelves, etc.--and the cost is psychological--it pains me to see my basement filled with tubs of stuff I don't need.

I spent some time in the basement today, and I have a long way to go. I know what to do. I just need to roll up my sleeves and get to work. I also need to close the Amazon tab I have open in this very browser window. 

This is not rocket surgery.
