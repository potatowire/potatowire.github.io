In the aftermath of another tragedy, I’d like to encourage you to quit Twitter.[^1]

I spent 82 seconds on Twitter today, and it nearly ruined my day. I follow all good people (As far as I recall, at least. It has been a while, after all.), and yet my timeline was filled with omnidirectional anger. This does no one any good. 

Events are best studied when the facts are all known and filtered by history. Even then, [beware](https://with.thegra.in/historical-accuracy). 

When emotions are high, people lash out indiscriminately, and that’s okay. It’s okay, because this is a way of grieving, and it is never wise to tell people how to feel. It’s okay, but that doesn’t mean it’s good for our souls to join in.

I can’t pretend to know what’s best for you, but I know I’m better off on the periphery of social media. Maybe join me.

[^1]:	Surely Facebook belongs on this list too. I assume it’s even worse over there (in most cases), but I quit Facebook a long time ago and can’t say for sure. I could extend this to watching cable news, but I am already in *old man yells at cloud* territory.
