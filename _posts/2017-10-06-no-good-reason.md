I am still awake, well after midnight, for no good reason. 

I was once more working on a jigsaw puzzle, while listening to learning material. Tonight it was random selections from my podcast subscriptions. I’m frustrated, because I know I’m going to get so little sleep tonight, but I also know I enjoyed having some quiet time to hear good ideas and to think. 

I will not judge myself for missing out on some much-needed sleep. I will be happy when the kiddos wake me up in a few short hours with the clamor of their playing. Actively deciding this now will prime me to react well in the morning.

I have a lot to be thankful for, and I will be thankful.
