Sometimes I change my mind about stuff. We all do, but sometimes it is hard to admit being wrong. I have always liked the idea of [strong opinions, weakly held](http://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/), but let me unpack that a little. 

The first part is easy for me, because I am very opinionated. If you were to follow me around all day, there could be no doubt of this fact. I seem constitutionally unable remain on the sidelines when I disagree with the course of a conversation. [I must engage](https://xkcd.com/386/).

I do always try to have an informed opinion, however. I am interested in virtually everything. When I'm interested in something, I read about it. When I read something, I learn about it. When I learn something, I form opinions about it. In my case, the absence of opinion means the presence of apathy.

The risk I run here is becoming too set in my ways and resistant to change. Because of this, I work hard to hold on to my opinions very loosely. This means I (occasionally?) must admit error, but at this point in my life I find an odd joy in admitting, "oh, I see what you're saying; I was wrong." I argue with myself all day long. My internal monologue is contentious, and I think this trains me to consider alternative ideas, even when they come from outside my own head.

Now, being too open-minded can put one at risk of exemplifying the old saying, ["if you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything"](http://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/02/18/stand-fall/). I don't worry about this for one simple reason: I remember being a teenager. I've talked about the concept of a [base state](http://with.thegra.in/the-river) in the past, and I think the teen years offer a pretty good view of how far we can fall. 

Since I am naturally opinionated, I have to work at listening to opposing thought. Derek Sivers [captures this principle very well](https://sivers.org/compensate). If you want to counteract a lifetime of thinking or doing something, you have to be *extreme* in your efforts to return the scales to neutral. Said another way, you have to work twice as hard to recover from a 50% deficit.

So, what brings this to mind, you ask? I have [rejoined Twitter](https://twitter.com/potatowire) and Slack. I even created a [Twitter account for this blog](https://twitter.com/WtG_feed). I [was certain quitting social media](http://with.thegra.in/its-not-you) was necessary to improve my focus, but *more recently*, I [became concerned this was a cop-out](http://with.thegra.in/results). I ought to be able to dip my toe into the stream of conversation on social media without being swept away. I think I need to be able to.

So, here we are. I am a [flip-flopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(politics)) and proud of it. I work hard at it.
