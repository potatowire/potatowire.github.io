I think I do better when I make rules for myself when starting a project. Case in point, my "restart" of this blog, [four long months ago](). I was careful to avoid stating expectations, but c'mon man. It's been four months!

So now I am going to make some rules. I'm going to set expectations. I plan to post something every weekday and most weekends. I'll probably skip most days I'm on vacation.

Many times the posts will be simple. God willing, sometimes they'll be substantial. Very rarely they may be good. But they will be.

Most of my free time is currently spent with my nose in a book, and I think most of my posts will be about what was interesting about the day's reading. sv
