I needed a lighter post today, so I decided to share this wonderful gif by [Justin Gammon][1]. 

This is even on-message, since I got it as a bonus for [pre-ordering][2] the Heath Brothers' [new book][3][^1], and as I've said before, their books are the best one-stop resource for each of the topics they've covered thus far.[^2]

I love the Heath Brothers and I love high fives.

[^1]:	I'll give you one American dollar if they don't discuss _chronos_ vs. _kairos_. If they do, it's guaranteed to be my favorite treatment of it.

[^2]:	Like a crazy person, I've read at least three additional books on each of these topics, so I am not making this claim from a place of ignorance
