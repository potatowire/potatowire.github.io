This project is still [complete](https://with.thegra.in/what-now), but I am back. 

I'm starting a new project in 2019, and I will no longer write it as potatowire. On January 31st, I will transition out of my 
Commanding Officer role. On March 1st, I will go on terminal leave, retiring June 1st from the Navy after 20 years on Active 
Duty. This is why I have been pseudonymous, but it's time to leave that behind.

So, what is the new project? It is called *[This Will Be Hard](https://thiswillbehard.com/), and there I will begin the next 
phase of my life. *It will be hard*, but I hope you'll join me.
