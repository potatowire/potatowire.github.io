How many things in your life were better because you reacted quickly? How often does a strong reaction turn out to be an overreaction, after the heat of the moment fades? Our reactions generally suck, but we rarely hold ourselves accountable for them. We should be better.

Don't reply in anger when you perceive a slight in an email chain. Don't curse the next time you are cut off in traffic. Don't grab your pitchfork the next time the Internet Outrage Machine sets its crosshairs on someone.

Compliment instead of critiquing. Be slow to anger and quick to forgive. Give others the benefit of the doubt and scrutinize your own motives. Listen completely before offering advice. Maybe only listen.

Deliberate and then react.
