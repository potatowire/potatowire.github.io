Argh, [so much angst][1].

I’m going to try another experiment here. Given my general dissatisfaction with the quality of my writing, I am going to move to a Tuesday and Thursday publishing schedule. The twice-weekly posts will be more ambitious than my recent navel-gazing. Because I am an all-or-nothing sort, I will still maintain a daily writing practice. I just won’t show my work.

If, in a month, I haven’t met my publishing schedule, or the quality of my work has not improved, I will go back to daily posting. Or quit writing forever. Depends on the magnitude of my angst.

Let the new phase commence.
