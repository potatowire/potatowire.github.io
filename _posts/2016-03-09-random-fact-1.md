I am too tired to write anything of value today. Instead I will leave you with a random fact:

The Nobel Prize began because [Alfred Nobel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Nobel) felt guilty. Perhaps most famous at the time for inventing dynamite, Alfred Nobel's obituary was published after a case of mistaken identity when his brother Ludvig died while visiting [Cannes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes). The newspaper there reported, "the merchant of death is dead," and not wanting this to be his legacy (he never married and had no children), he bequeathed 94% of his total estate to establish five Nobel Prizes.
