I’m a strong believer in avoiding the middle.

What middle? Every point between 0 and 1, on and off, good and bad.

> You can use this same rule on yourself if you’re often overcommitted or too scattered. If you’re not saying, “*Hell yeah!*” about something, say no. When deciding whether to do something, if you feel anything less than “Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!” then say no. 
> 
> When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes you say, “*Hell yeah!*” 
> 
> For every event you get invited to, every request to start a new project, if you’re not saying, “*Hell yeah!*” about it, say no. 
> 
> We’re all busy. We’ve all taken on too much. Saying yes to less is the way out.[^1]

Laodicea "I know your works: you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were either cold or hot! So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth."[^2]
