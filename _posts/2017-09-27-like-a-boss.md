I have to lay down the law tomorrow at work.

When you’re a young employee[^1], no one tells you the boss doesn’t enjoy being a jerk. That they’re only doing what has to be done. That they’d much prefer everyone was happy and joking around with each other. That work was a good place to be. 

Well, maybe I should just say *this* boss doesn’t like being a jerk. One of my early bosses maybe did have fun with it.
