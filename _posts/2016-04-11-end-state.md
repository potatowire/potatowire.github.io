I am no longer going to post here every day.

I was [certain that I was back in](https://twitter.com/potatowire/status/718878327063207936) after [a period of doubt](http://with.thegra.in/doubt), and I was very moved by the thoughtful replies I received. I *was* certain, and then I changed my mind. I seem [prone to this](http://with.thegra.in/flip-flopper).

Much of the feedback I received referenced writing as a passion, and having a handle on the the "why" of it. Another one of my favorite people compared the discipline of daily writing to a fitness plan, which I think is very apt. These were the lenses through which I examined this decision.

Specifically, I considered the best possible end state. I've [expressed](https://twitter.com/potatowire/status/710878588321402880) a dream of being full-time writer before, but it was a nebulous hope. Today I pinned it down. What would I love about this ideal end state?

What would be so great about being a full-time writer? Being a best-selling author? Would it be the joy of the written word? Would it be joy of affecting many lives? Would I be happy having my own [writer's hut](http://calnewport.com/blog/2015/02/19/j-k-rowlings-magical-writing-hut-and-the-pursuit-of-true-depth/)?

What would I love most?

I realized that I am most passionate about the written word, but about *reading* the written word.  I love hearing the spoken word. I love learning new information any way I can. I love synthesizing seemingly disparate ideas. I love making complex ideas easier to understand.

I have no idea if this could ever be a [profession](https://xkcd.com/827/), but this is what I want to do every day. I want to spend the [free time](http://with.thegra.in/time) I have doing what I love *most*. 

I want to read, listen, watch, and learn. I want to think.

Is this blog dead? I don't know. Probably? One of the ways I find out what I think is by writing about a topic, and then [editing it to within an inch of its life](http://with.thegra.in/brevity). So, I *think* I will post here periodically. I hope I will. I'm just not going to make myself do it.

I'm [finished](http://with.thegra.in/finished), and I think I'm okay with that.
