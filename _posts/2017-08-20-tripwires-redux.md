As I mentioned [yesterday][1], I use one other trick when managing my memory.

If there is something I need to remember to do, that doesn’t fall into one of my other memory baskets, I set a tripwire. The concept here isn’t much different than [the tripwires I discussed][2] in my [series on judgment and decision making][3], but a tripwire in this case is specifically an external reminder that happens outside of my attention. Something that prompts me to take action directly or get out a set of project notes.

A couple examples might help. The most common tripwire is time and date based. A calendar event would be fine here, but I like to keep only meetings[^1] and travel on my calendar. With this in mind I use the [Due app on iOS][4]. I don’t set start dates or anything fancy like that. Instead, I put something in Due if it has to happen at a certain time.

Another example is correspondence. I make a conscious effort to do everything possible in person, so my email work is minimal. Because of this, I can send off an email, secure in the knowledge that I don’t care if I ever receive an email in return. If I do receive a response, maybe that means I need to do something. 

In the rare case I *need* an email response, I put a note on the “Email/Phone/Correspondence” page of my notebook. This acts  as a tripwire too, because each morning when I check my [cards][5], I also check the card on my desk that includes the various categories[^2] of work I may need to do. Additionally, I flip through my notebook Wednesdays after lunch, as a final check to make sure nothing gets lost.[^3]

So there’s the short version of my memory strategy. Notice that most of it is really about purposely not remembering things when they don’t matter. This means I have a lot of spare brain cycles to pay attention to what’s going on around me. I don’t know if it makes me productive, but it does make me effective.

[^1]:	Like all sane people, I hate meetings, so these are extremely minimal. My calendar is a wasteland, just the way I like it.

[^2]:	The category list must be no larger than working-memory sized, naturally.

[^3]:	I purposely make this a flip-through process, rather than any sort of electronic search, because I want to see my other work at this stage of my day. Getting a look at everything in my notebook allows me to see connections, in an [*adjacent possible*][6] sort of way. Capture has to be without [novelty][7], but work is made more creative when there are a lot of inputs, bringing the unexpected connections that arise as a result. You might just have to trust me on this one, and try it yourself.
