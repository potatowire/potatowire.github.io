Today I pre-ordered the new [9.7" iPad Pro](http://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/), but I'm worried. It's not about the RAM, although [that may be a problem](https://twitter.com/potatowire/status/712623857367064576). I'm worried that I am trying to buy another shortcut.

With the benefit of hindsight, I am able to look back at my adult life and see the many times I have done this. I wanted to be more active, so I bought hiking and camping gear. I wanted to exercise more, so I bought some weights. I wanted to run more, [so I bought a fancy watch](). I'm having trouble taking notes when I am [reading to learn](http://with.thegra.in/reading-to-learn-1), so I bought an iPad with the [Pencil](http://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/). These things all have something in common: they didn't build the habits I was trying to form. 

There is something different about the last two, however. I cancelled the watch purchase, which was delayed anyway, but I have been running. With the iPad, I have a problem to solve, but I *know* it's not the solution. I just hope it will help. Plus, I *am* an iPad guy. I use my [mini](http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini-4/) all the time now, and my wife's non-Retina mini is on its last leg. We have a "need" for a replacement anyway. 

Still, I don't want this to be a thing I do. I think I am much more savvy on [habits](http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business/dp/081298160X), and [have](http://with.thegra.in/daily-logging) [successfully](http://with.thegra.in/make-your-bed) [formed](http://with.thegra.in/morning-routine) [many](http://with.thegra.in/dont-snooze) new ones since I tried my last shortcut. I am more attuned to my brain's stupid tricks. 

So, I am going to try this out, but I'm not betting everything on it. This won't be the linchpin. It is just a very expensive test. 

I'll let you know how it turns out.
