The last few [worry][1] posts have centered on mental attitude, and this area of focus could be expanded well beyond Dale Carnegie's treatment of it.

Al Smith entered the New York State legislature with a grade school education, having had to go to to work as a child to help provide for his family. When he got his first look at a law under discussion, it was completely impenetrable to him. Not willing to admit defeat, he spent every waking hour studying this and subsequent laws
