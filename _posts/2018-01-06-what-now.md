Well, this project is complete. *With the Grain* is now closed.

It's been a while since I've produced anything of value here, and leaving things unresolved has been a mental tax 
on everything since. So, I'm going offline.

Since I like some of what I wrote here, I may someday make a good landing page for this site, and curate it in some way. If 
something particularly resonated with you, [let me know](mailto:me@potatowire.com).
 
I may sometimes feel the need to say something, in order to get it out of my head, and I do want to keep working on the 
bigger picture, fitting together what I've learned. For those times, and if I ever have a new project to share, I will send it 
out to my email [list](http://thegra.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7712b37391b550e3826c38f34&id=bec2c14066).

Be well.
