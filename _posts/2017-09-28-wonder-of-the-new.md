As I currently spend most of my free time exploring and learning, I am periodically struck by just how much information there is online,[^1] freely available.

I think what gets me, is this feeling that I might stumble on some new idea that could change everything. Something that could [unlock][1] the *next big thing* for me. Sometime in the uncertain near-future, I am going to retire from the Navy, and when I do, I will need *another thing* to provide for my family. Online there are infinite *things*, and I just need to keep picking through them, looking for mine. 

The wonder of the new is what keeps me from excess television, video games, and other short-term diversions. There is just too much to explore.

Iâ€™d better get back to it.

[^1]:	Often this online information points me to a book, which is of course just the internet's slower cousin.
