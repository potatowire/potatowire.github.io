[Did I mention][1] I would be taking November off?

I’ve also been thinking about what I want to do with my lighter fare. It’s stuff that would once have gone on Twitter, but that’s no longer a happy place for me. I’ve often posted ephemera here, but I like the idea of this site being populated with more fully-formed thoughts. Because of that, I set up a separate sub-site that will include more nonsense. 

I am calling it [*Stream*][2] based on Robin Sloan’s concept of [*Stock and Flow*][3]. Because I am more wedded to the term *flow* as Mihály Csíkszentmihályi [uses it][4], I chose *stream* as variation of *flow*.

[Take a look][5], and let me know what you think.
