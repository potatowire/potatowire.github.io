I had a little time this weekend to chip away at my various "consumption" queues. Saturday seems like a good day to share these with you, dear reader, so here is some of the video content I no longer have to "Watch Later."

I enjoy hobby electronics, and a friend of mine sent me this video.

This open-source device may be of little interest to most of you, but it does an amazing array of different, but mostly-related tasks. The video production-value leaves a lot to be desired, but in a way, this is emblematic of the entire open source movement: powerful and often a bit ugly.

From here, the magic YouTube [algorithms](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/footnote) served me up this video.

In it, the circuit board for a [midcentury-style lighted arrow](http://satelluxe.com/products/bristow) is made from scratch and installed. I liked this video quite a lot.

I followed up these admittedly nerdy selections with some videos of brave people risking life and limb. The first one documents Alex Honnold [free-soloing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_solo_climbing) [El Sendero Luminoso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Sendero_Luminoso) in a little over 3 hours.

No thank you.

My other vicarious adventuring was through [Danny MacAskill](http://www.dannymacaskill.co.uk/).

He is amazing, and I love each and every one of his videos. [What he accomplishes on a bike](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=danny+macaskill) should not be possible. 

The last item for today was [*Ex Machina*](http://www.amazon.com/Ex-Machina-Alicia-Vikander/dp/B011KKCQH8/], the directorial debut of [Alex Garland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Garland). This selection involves a much larger time commitment, but I think it is worth it, and I say that as someone tried and failed to watch this movie a couple months ago. I'm not sure what was different this time, but I was quickly hooked. I didn't love it as much as many other nerds did, but I thought it was very thought-provoking and good. Plus, it has [Oscar Isaac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Isaac) (Poe Dameron in *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*) in it, and he is great. A final warning, don't watch this movie around children or Puritans.

To cap off today's clearing of the queue, I wrote this post while listening to [Bach: Goldberg Variations](http://www.amazon.com/Bach-Goldberg-Variations-Glenn-Gould/dp/B0000025PM), which has been on my music to-do list [since 2012](http://www.amazon.com/Bach-Goldberg-Variations-Glenn-Gould/dp/B0000025PM). [Seth](http://twitter.com/DrBunsen) has good taste.
