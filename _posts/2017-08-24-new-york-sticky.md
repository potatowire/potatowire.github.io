In Chip and Dan Heath's [*Made to Stick*][1], they expand on Malcolm Gladwell's [concept][2] of a [*sticky*][3] idea.[^1] One of the things that strengthens a message's ability to resonate with a learner/listener/customer is if the claim is *credible*. One path to credibility is by way of their *Sinatra Test*:

> In Frank Sinatra‘s classic “New York, New York,” he sings about starting a new life in New York City, and the chorus declares, “If I can make it there, I’ll make it anywhere.” An example passes the Sinatra Test when *one example alone* is enough to establish credibility in a given domain. For instance, if you've got the security contract for Fort Knox, you’re in the running for *any* security contract (even if you have no other clients). If you catered a White House function, you can compete for any catering contract. It’s the Sinatra Test: If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.[^2]

This is so easily understood and unforgettable. I really enjoy the way the Heaths write and teach. I recommend all their books, especially if you’re only interested in reading one treatment of a topic.
