“The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go.”

-Dr. Seuss

I go through phases when all I want to do is learn. During these periods, I can’t get enough new information, and I rarely waste time on my usual internet distractions. 

I also go through phases when I need lighter fare. During these periods, I read memoirs or *turns out* pop science, and I fall down lots of internet rabbit holes.

This best decision I ever made was to stop trying to control which phase I’m in. It’s pointless, and I invariably learn something worthwhile anyway. This is the basis of the[*adjacent possible*][1], and it's vital to creativity.

It’s all about getting [better][2].
