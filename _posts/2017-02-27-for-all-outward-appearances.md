This morning I began [Volume II]() of the [Last Lion] biography of Winston Churchill.[^*] I missed him. One passage jumped out at me in particular, and I see a parallel in it to my life.

> The [breakfast] tray has gone. Remaining within reach are the jam and a weak (three-ounce) scotch and soda—always Johnny Walker Red—which the prostrate Winston will sip occasionally over the next four hours in the tradition of Palmerston, Pitt, and Baldwin. However, the legend that he is a heavy drinker is quite untrue. Churchill is a sensible, if unorthodox, drinker. There is always some alcohol in his bloodstream, and it reaches its peak late in the evening after he has had two or three scotches, several glasses of champagne, at least two brandies, and a highball, but his family never sees him the worse for drink. He remarks: “We all despise a man who gets drunk.” And, after an exchange of views on drinking: “All I can say is that I have taken more out of alcohol than alcohol has taken out of me.” He encourages absurd myths about his alcoholic capacity, however, partly to furbish his macho image, which needs it because he cries so often in public (“ I’m a blubberer,” he cheerfully tells friends), and partly because Europeans still like to think that their leaders are men who can hold their liquor. Winston tipples off and on all day but never gets drunk.[^*]

Leaving aside whether or not Churchill needed to demonstrate manliness or a mastery of drink, there is validity in the idea of projecting and obscuring aspects of one's own personality. This is even more the case if one is a leader, and in one way or other we are all leaders.

Speaking for myself, I will generalize and say I am an executive. As such, I have discovered that my moods greatly affect those around me. By personality, I am introverted, and, though not prone to black moods, I often become quiet when not in a particularly good mood. This does not work well, since I am in charge.

If I spend a morning sulking, by all outward appearances, the train of folks moving through my office sense disapproval irrespective of my actual words, and this rippled outward causing successive visitors to begin on the defensive, maybe holding back some pieces of the story, all because I am at best quiet, and at worst cranky.

As I noticed this effect, I began doing two things. First, I make every effort to be as {effusive} as possible, feigning a good mood when one isn't naturally occurring. Because I am not a tireless actor, I also employ a secondary measure by nurturing a good mood at the beginning of each day. I do this primarily by spending the first part of every day at work reading something I enjoy. This used to feel like I was shirking work, but now I know this step is more important than getting out my to-do list or checking email.

While I will certainly never be a Churchill, my habit of fostering the right aspect of my personality has worked quite well within my sphere of influence. Life at work and at home is far better when no one thinks they need to walk on eggshells in my presence. Accomplishing this self-consciously means that it doesn't require a draw on my mental reserves. 

How about you? Are you projecting the image you intend? I hope I am. I am starting to second-guess the scotch and soda I just poured, however. I'm starting to get some surprised looks.
