Tonight was another night my wife was out with friends, so this meant [another night][1] spent working on the same jigsaw puzzle while listening to an audiobook.

This time the book was [Blitzed: Drugs in the Third Reich][2], and it sure seems like the continued freedom of Western Civilization is owed in large part to Hitler's greedy, conniving, sycophantic personal physician. It is interesting to hear this perspective on the history I already know.

Regardless, it was once again, a wonderful evening. The puzzle is a toughie, however, and even now I want to climb out of bed and see if I can finish up the corner I was working on. 

I do love the simple things in life.
