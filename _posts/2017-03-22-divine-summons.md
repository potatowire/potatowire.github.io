During [The Blitz][2], all of London saw destruction wrought by [Göring][3]'s bombers. No one felt safe and no one was immune.

> ...South across the Thames and along its banks stretched Southwark, where the Archbishop of Canterbury[^1] kept his official residence, Lambeth Palace. When the bombs threatened his cathedral and its treasures, the archbishop expressed his deep concern to Churchill, who assured the prelate that every precaution had been taken to protect it. The archbishop asked what would happen if a bomb were to score a direct hit. Churchill, ever ready with a blasphemous aside, replied, “In that case, my dear Archbishop, you will have to regard it as a divine summons.”[^2]
