Yesterday I finished two books {{book links}}. I like to read three normal-sized books between the long biographies I've been reading[^1], and these two were a perfect change of pace. I don't plan to reread either book on a [set timeline](), but I know I'll  pull both books off the shelf a lot in the future.

## No Excuses! ##

I decided to read[^2] this when I came across it in [Audible Channels] Sel-improvement list. It definitely has the self-help guru tone, but I didn't find it off-putting. The book centers on self-discipline and consists of {{x}} parts:{{sections}}. I've read other books that hit these same points in other ways, but I liked Tracy's methodology. I like to have a couple techniques I can reference, depending on the rut I am in at any particular time, and I think this book will resonate. I found it motivational in general.

## Bird by Bird ##

{{author}}'s book is an irreverent and realistic look at writing, primarily geared towards the fiction writer. While I don't feel like I will ever seriously write fiction myself, the tools she provides are valuable for any creative endeavor. Like *Excuses*, I found this book motivational. Some other writing books I've enjoyed and been motivated by are {{list}}.

{{author}} also includes the, probably canonical version, of one of my favorite anecdotes that I've never heard widely shared. I'll close with it.
