I worry about this site. I spend an average of two hours a night writing, and I'm not sure why. I am more introspective now, for sure, and I think my writing is improving, but this two-hour block represents all of my available free [time](http://with.thegra.in/time). I have some other projects I would like to begin, but I don't know how to fit them into my schedule. 

I could write less often, but I suspect that losing the pressure of posting daily would start the blog's slow death. Instead of enduring a slow demise, maybe I should just [end things decisively](http://i.imgur.com/LwBs0am.gif). Would that just be giving up?

Part of the problem is I don't have an end state in mind. I worry about [not finishing what I start](http://with.thegra.in/finished), but what does finished look like in this case? Fame and fortune? I am anonymous, after all.

I have no idea how to properly track the number of readers here, but every indication is that it's a very flat, and small number. So it's not like I am making a very big difference in the world here. This is not a good way to assess value, but I can't think of a better measurement.

So, I don't know the answer. I don't even know the question. I am just filled with doubt.
