Today I [continued](http://with.thegra.in/owning-on-purpose) my battle against clutter by tackling my garage. Let me tell you, I have made a lot of bad purchasing decisions in the past. Having clearly demonstrated this potential, I think I need someone to monitor my decision-making.

I'll just give you one example of past-me's idiocy. Last summer I lost my nearly-free lawn care service and therefore had to buy a lawnmover of my own. Because they are [expensive](http://thesweethome.com/reviews/best-lawnmower/), I decided I would buy an [old-fashioned push mower](http://www.amazon.com/Scotts-2000-20-20-Inch-Classic-Mower/dp/B00004RA3E) instead. 

Sure, I knew it would be a bit of a pain, but it would be good exercise, right? Over the next hour or so, I succeeded in only finishing a tiny little section of my lawn. Noticing my struggle, a neighbor took pity on me and had my borrow his *normal* mower. I bought my own normal mower shortly thereafter.

Well, I let this reminder of my fallibility sit in my garage for a whole year until today when I put it out on the curb with a "free" sign attached to it. Someone grabbed it within 30 minutes.

Mistaaaaaaaaaaake!
