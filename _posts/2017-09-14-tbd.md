Having spent some time on [worry][1], I’m going to do a series, of indeterminate length, on Nassim Nicholas Taleb's [*Fooled by Randomness*][2].

I’ve written [about Taleb][3] [before][4], but I want to talk about _Fooled by Randomness_ now, because, counterintuitively, randomness[^1] helps me with my worry. Understanding that most things are outside our control, and accepting this fact, permits more peace after a decision is made or as life happens to us. We do the best we can and then let go, standing ready to deal with what comes next.

Stay tuned.


[^1]:	More on this later, but since I believe in God, me saying *randomness* is not strictly accurate. The lack of personal control inherent in God's will or in random chance makes this a distinction without a difference.
