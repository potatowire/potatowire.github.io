> Of course, it can be irresponsible to rely completely on the computer’s pattern recognition skills, since the human eye will pick up image errors or flubbed data inputs in a way that the machine may not. But a man–machine team is less vulnerable to machine oversights; human supervision is often stipulated by the companies that market medical software.[^1]

> The major dating services use artificial intelligence to recommend romantic matches, and this makes a difference because those selections very often differ from what individuals would have chosen for themselves. For instance, eHarmony has gone from analyzing a few dozen variables per user to six hundred variables per user (a figure that may well be obsolete by the time you are reading this). Those variables include not just profile information but also how frequently users log in, whom they search for, and which profiles they actually decide to write to. One problem, of course, is that a lot of the data are based on self-reporting, and the answers of the respondents may be careless or outright lies based in the hope of being offered better and more exclusive matches. The algorithms also tend to select for similarities, and that may encourage initial meetings, but it is less clear it will produce happier marriages thirty years down the line.[^2]

> The current case for the software is not that it can turn love into a statistically measurable algorithm. We’d be foolish to ignore the importance of conversational rhythms and sniffs and smells and sexual chemistry and how long-term compatibility evolves over the years and decades. Nonetheless, the software is getting users to look twice at some prospects they might otherwise have passed over or never seen in the first place. Here is one romance from Match.com:[^3]
> 
>> Viewing the profile, Cambry, who is black, saw a pretty young white woman who lived nearby and seemed to share his interest in music. He sent her a short e-mail to say hello, and within a day received an e-mail from Karrah O’Daniel, an opera singer. Their first date was a flop, but they made it to a second date, and soon Cambry and O’Daniel were getting serious. It turns out they had attended the same music school, but never met there. They took to playing pieces by Franz Liszt together, recording videos that they would post on YouTube. Six months later, he proposed. The two are to wed on October 1 at a church in Minnesota.[^4]
>>
>> As often happens in love, the woman Cambry fell for is not exactly the woman he thought he wanted. “I wasn’t expecting that the person I was going to marry would be a white woman from Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota,” he says. Nor did Cambry fit neatly into O’Daniel’s idea of who she would marry. According to her Match profile, she was looking for a man between the ages of 21 and 26 [Cambry was then 28]. Cambry, by O’Daniel’s own standards, was too old for her. In fact, Cambry and O’Daniel never really searched for one another at all. They were introduced by the algorithm.[^5]
