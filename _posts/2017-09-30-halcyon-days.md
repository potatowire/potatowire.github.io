I couldn’t write, so I watched nineties-era [id][1] video game play-throughs on YouTube. 

I still don’t know what to write, but now I am not just blocked. I’m blocked *and* nostalgic. If you ever played Doom on your librarian's computer,[^1] you would probably enjoy [*Masters of Doom*][2] by David Kushner. It’s fascinating to read about programmers from this era. What programmers can create now boggles the mind, but what was built back then *feels* so much more impressive. I can barely write a script now without Googling, and yet I once wrote a simple PDA program on my calculator,[^2] using only the manual that came in the box.

This brings me back to the [wonder][5] engendered by all the information now online. Sometimes I worry I’ve lost my tenacity with the exponential increase in options for everything. For example, I used to get very good at very difficult video games, because I only had one game. Now I can download a new one the instant I get frustrated or bored.

Is this something vital I’ve now lost forever, or am I just old? I don’t know for sure, but I do know it is past my bedtime.

[^1]:	I have vivid memories of this, and yet I now need redundant systems to keep from losing my car keys.
