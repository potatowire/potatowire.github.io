I've long had an aspirational goal for my reading, which I've heard longtime reader/learners do: Finish a book; capture rough impressions within a day or so; and re-read a week or two later, pen in hand. Lather, rinse, repeat. Today I will put this in practice for the first time.

Last night I finished {{last lion}}. It was a sometimes slow-going read, but I enjoyed it immensely. I am largely ignorant of English history and was happy to have a telling of it without an American perspective.

Now, on to some takeaways:

* Churchill had such a loveless, lonely childhood. Mrs. {{dear lady}} was his primary caregiver and her portrait ever hung on his various office walls. 
* It was interesting to see him hold on to Victorian ideals as society moved on. While some of this had shades of racism characteristic of the British Empire, he never held unexamined or static opinions for long. {{unworthy of him}}* 
* Went from being an indifferent, below-average student to a highly prolific, world-renowned author. At various points the most highly paid as well. Went from a speaker most recognizable for his lisp to the most noteworthy orator among a House of Commons filled with top orators. And this is still before WWII.
* Very changeable: From the Army to the first lord of the Admiralty back to the Army--in office and out. He is the father of the tank! He learned to fly at the dawn of aviation! Went from the Liberal party to the Torries, ran as an Independent, then back to the Liberals. 
*  Never quit: He made, lost, and made again a fortune. He was in and out of the House of Commons, in and out of Cabinet positions, in and out of public affection (the Dardanelles) and attention. He had a price on his head when working for the Free Irish State (they succeeded in killing Michael Collins and others, so not idle threats). Ends the book in 1932 recovering from being hit by a taxi in New York and entering the "political wilderness."

This book weigh in just under 1,000 pages, so a second, closer re-read will be no mean feat. Just writing this post makes me want to get back to it, so maybe the odds are good in the end.
