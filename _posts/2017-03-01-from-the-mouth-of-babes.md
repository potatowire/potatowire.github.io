I had a very helpful conversation with my 2-year-old son this morning. He was watching a surprisingly interesting episode of [*Bob the Builder*](https://www.amazon.com/Bob-Builder-Site-Trains-Treehouses/dp/B005SFZOPI) that I thought had some good learning material. 

"Are you learning some good stuff, buddy?"   
"No, Daddy, I love trucks!"

Besides being adorable, his response got my mental wheels turning. I am a bit obsessed with learning. I read during just about every free minute of every day. I am often consciously learning, but even in the case of fiction or something else light, I am trying to maximize the number of quality inputs to my brain.

My son raises a good point though. [Yesterday](https://with.thegra.in/preconceptions) I mentioned [the beginner's mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin), but there could just as easily be a corollary to this overarching mindset. Namely, this should be fun. 

The reason I read so much is I love reading. I'm reading far more non-fiction than I used to because that's what is most interesting to me. I'm reading [very](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Years_of_Lyndon_Johnson) [long](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Lion:_Winston_Spencer_Churchill) biographies because I want to.

I need to remember this during the inevitable time when a particular book just doesn't sink its hooks into me. I must be willing to put it aside and move on to a different book. I must be willing to read a bunch of fiction, if non-fiction loses its allure. I must be willing to just watch some television, if reading feels like work (perish the thought).

This should be fun. If it isn't, I'm doing it wrong.
