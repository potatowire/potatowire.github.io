I really enjoy watching sports on the weekend. I also enjoy reading super-nerdy books. I use both of these loves as a way to train my focus. 

There are countless articles out there worrying about how modern technology and social media are destroying our ability to focus, and while I’m not sure how dire the situation truly is, I do think the ability to focus deeply can be a super power. The way I cultivate this skill is by switching back and forth between my book and the sports coverage, seeking laser focus each time. Because I read with a pencil in my hand, taking notes, I can tell whether or not my focus is truly returning to my book. My goal in running these drills is to reduce the penalty I suffer when returning to deep focus after distractions.

I’m not sure I know how to measure any improvements I might make in this regard, but I am happy with my anecdotal evidence.
