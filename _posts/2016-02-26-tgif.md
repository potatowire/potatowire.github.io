One of my favorite things to do on Twitter was to post a TGIF gif each Friday, so I am going to start doing that here too. I'll use some old favorites first before dipping into the stockpile.

Here is President George W. Bush to start us off.

I don't care what your politics are, this gif is hilarious.

Enjoy your weekend.
