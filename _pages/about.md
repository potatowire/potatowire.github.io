## About the Author

I am a pseudonomymous nobody often found on the interwebs. I came up with "potatowire" during the good ol' days when people were afraid to use their real name online. As time passed and this fact changed, my job as [REDACTED] made me want to stay mostly anonymous.

Why this site is called "[With the Grain](https://with.thegra.in/with-the-grain)."

The site design is courtesy of the wonderful and talented [Erik Hess](http://themindfulbit.com/). He is the best.

The colorscheme is [Solarized Dark](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) by [Ethan Schoonover](https://twitter.com/ethanschoonover). He is also the best.
