I’m not exactly blocked, but my thoughts are tumultuous. 

I’ve written and discarded so many words today. I've started and stopped at least a half-dozen posts. 

My thoughts are jumbled, and therefore my writing is too. I seem to lack either the mental clarity or discipline to sort them out. 

I may be trying to fix too many things at once. Tomorrow I’ll pick just one.
