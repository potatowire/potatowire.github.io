Today was a good day for family activities, reorganizing the house, and not packing for a work trip. As I was doing most of these things, I burned through my whole podcast cue. As such, I pulled forward some other episodes I’d been saving.

First up was [*Containers*][1] by Alexis Madrigal about global trade. I enjoyed it and thought it was very good overall. It may have been just me, but the audio mixing seemed more artsy than functional, because I too often had to work hard to hear what being said.

Second up was Dan Carlin's [*Hardcore History*][2]. Please listen to this show if you haven’t already. Carlin is so good, and his intellectual honesty is refreshing. If you don’t know where to start, maybe begin with [“Blueprint for Armageddon”][3] about World War I. This is probably a terrible recommendation, since the shortest of the episodes in this five-part series is 3 hours long, but I don’t think we as a culture know enough about WWI. Carlin fixes this problem magnificently.

Alright, instead of packing, I'm going to go to bed. I’m sure everything will be better in the morning.
