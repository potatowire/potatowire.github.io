I’m not less [not-exactly-blocked](https://with.thegra.in/tumult), but I’m working on it.

I spent my spare cycles today cultivating [boredom](https://with.thegra.in/embrace-boredom), trying to let my thoughts find their natural order. Given my broken brain, this may not be wise. 

On the plus side, things outside of my own head are fine. Tomorrow’s going to be busy, and busy is very often useful. Hard to navel-gaze when there’s lots to do. 

Onward.
