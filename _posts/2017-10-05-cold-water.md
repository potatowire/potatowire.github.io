Tonight seems like a good time to update the progress on my [week's goal][1]. In one word, failure.

I forgot my own cardinal rule of habit setting: a new habit has to begin with *one* thing *so easy* I can’t help but follow through. I figured my desired routine was simple enough. That it was easy enough. Nope.

The first couple days, perfect. Then, my old friend *fatigue* set in. You see, even my "easy" routine required an additional hour or so of extra time, and because I am perpetually sleep-deprived, I <strike>couldn’t</strike> didn’t get up early enough yesterday to make it happen. Not even my public commitment here could get me out of bed, because I didn’t just need to do just *one* thing. I had to do *four* things. Four things is way too much for sleeping-me to handle. I’m might as well do *no* thing.

Except I did manage to stick with one part of my plan, because I kept up with my entry into cold therapy. Since I take a shower in the morning every day, I can just use full cold water while shampooing my hair. In other words, time is no factor. Plus, it is only *one* thing, so I can’t help but follow through.

Now, I absolutely *hate* the cold until it’s over, but *man*, it’s worth it. Turning the temperature knob down[^1] requires a true act of will, but this act of discipline first thing in the morning starts the day out on the right foot.[^2] As I said, I *hate* the cold water, but I’m starting to believe there’s something to all the claims of its benefits. I feel great for hours after even this very minimal cold therapy. 

So maybe this week’s goal is—so far—a partial success, rather than complete failure. I’ll take it.

[^1]:	Our water is mountain cold too.

[^2]:	[Not snoozing][2] my alarm should make this my *second* act of discipline of the day, but my aforementioned fatigue ruined that habit more than a year ago. Foreshadowing for this Sunday's post.
