Well, here we are again at the beginning of another week. That means it’s [weekly goal][1] time.[^1]

[Last week][2] my *one goal* was to not snooze my alarm. I will mark this one a qualified success. I did not snooze my alarm, but I also had a couple of days I really didn’t have an alarm, and at least one morning seemed to involve a very pronounced delay between my alarm being turned off and my feet hitting the floor. A *qualified* success.

So, what’s on tap for this week? I want to delay all morning electronic device use by 15 minutes. I currently check email, news, and social media when I wake up, and while it doesn’t seem to negatively affect me, I can’t discount the evidence that suggests it should be.

Additionally, I like to prime my subconscious mind with a problem before bed,[^2] but I’m pretty sure my current morning routine doesn’t allow sufficient breathing room for a solutions hand-off from my subconscious to my waking mind. This shift in routine might better allow flashes of inspiration to hit. 

Regardless, I think the less [frittering][3] the better.



[^1]:	Hopefully you’re playing along at home. If so, send me an email to let me know how you’re doing. If you’ve blogged about it, send me a link, and I’ll include it in my post next week. 

[^2]:	There’s some evidence—and lots of anecdotes—that suggests our subconscious minds in sleep can be very creative. I may return to this in a future post.
