"However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results."

The Internet's Winston Churchill.

Unfortunately, when doing my due diligence for [quote day](http://with.thegra.in/nuance) I discovered that Sir Winston Churchill [did not say this](http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support?catid=0&id=1648). Even better, the linked refutation is in response to a set of quotes intended to motivate "traders and analysts." Still better, the blog itself is by an ostensibly [stoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism) trader. This feels like a microcosm of the internet itself, but I digress.

Regardless, I do think this is a good quote for a blog like this, which may fall victim to big ideas and fancy strategies. In the face of this tendency, it is important to step back periodically to be purely practical. Will this new idea, which feels so revolutionary and delightful, actually work in the real world? Will it also work for me?

Speaking for myself now, I promise to tell you if something here is just an idea I have, rather than something I have put in place in my life with noticeable and beneficial results. This writing is as much for me as for you, so honesty is paramount. For instance, [I *know* quitting social media has improved my focus](http://with.thegra.in/its-not-you), but today as I was listening to [Tim Ferris interview Kevin Kelly](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/08/29/kevin-kelly/), he mentioned in passing that quitting social media is kind of a cop-out (paraphrasing).

I need to think about this some more.
