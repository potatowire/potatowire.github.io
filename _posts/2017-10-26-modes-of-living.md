I think any habit or self-discipline needs to exist within two modes: _stable_ and _unstable equilibrium_.[^1]

An ingrained habit is in _stable_ equilibrium. For example, I brush my teeth every morning when I wake up and every night before bed. This is true when I travel, have a long day, or something interrupts me on the way to the bathroom sink. If extraordinary circumstances cause me miss a teeth-brushing, it requires zero effort—or even conscious thought—to resume the habit the next day. This habit is in equilibrium with my life. It continues without an energy requirement.

On the other hand, my morning [cold therapy][4] habit, for example, is in _unstable_ equilibrium. It requires (_immense_) self-discipline to turn the shower faucet full-cold. If I miss a day, resuming the habit is very hard.[^2] this habit is in unstable equilibrium with my life. It stays in place, in balance, only with effort.

There are degrees of stability, too. For example, my normal way of eating[^3] is easily disrupted by travel or bad days, but I easily settle back into my routine when life returns to normal. This habit is in partial equilibrium with my life. It requires some energy to maintain balance, but if I leave it completely unmanaged, all bets are off.

The reason I think this is a useful way of thinking about habits is it can help us in methodology and in recovery when we backslide from an otherwise good pattern of behavior. When we are creating a new habit, we do so with a good stretch of normal days ahead of us. We also decide at the outset how we will deal with disruptions to our equilibrium. For example, I only maintain certain aspects of my normal diet while traveling.[^4] If the disruptions are long-term or regular, it requires a more involved habit-plan.

[^2]:	In fact, I took a break, because of a bad cold (ironically), and even though I’m pretty much all better, I’m still finding excuses to not resume what _was_ a daily practice.

[^3]:	The details don’t really matter here, but for the curious: I eat one meal a day (a stricter form of [intermittent fasting](), generally called the [Warrior Diet]()), and that meal only restriction that any carbohydrates come only from healthy vegetables (no added sugar). I have three cheat meals at various times during the week, still intermittently fasting. This may sound hard to do, but I eased into it. Send me an email if your struggle with your weight. I have test plan we can try, with some one-on-one coaching/cheerleading.

[^4]:	Specifically, I still intermittently fast, but I eat my one meal whenever it makes sense, and I don’t sweat the carbs.
