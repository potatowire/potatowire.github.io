Today was [a true Monday](http://i.imgur.com/41vmZ9q.gif), and I still have more day-job work to go. Because of that, I will be brief.

I have a concept that I use in my head, which I call an idea stub. The terminology comes from [Wikipedia's article stubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub), and I use it to mark a concept that I think has some merit, but still needs further thought and testing in practice. I will likely use this in the future to discuss some things that don't meet the standard [I discussed yesterday](http://with.thegra.in/results).
