We’ve established that I’m [shooting from the hip here][1], right?

As I was going through [_How to Stop Worrying_][2] today, I realized just how many posts remain before I’ve covered the whole book. I’ll wear everyone out before then—even writing about other stuff on the weekends. 

Because of all this, my new plan is to finish Part 4 in the book (concluding the topic of *mental attitude*) and then do some writing on other topics. I have some other short series already planned, and I’ll return to Carnegie periodically.

At least that’s the plan...
