I put today's topic squarely in the category of things I thought were stupid but tried anyway. I was never very good about making my bed when growing up. My mom tried her best, but I'm stubborn, and the habit didn't stick. I always subscribed to the notion that, "'it's just going to be unmade again tonight."

Given this, it's safe to say that I was skeptical when [I heard Tim Ferriss](http://pca.st/4sxY#t=382) say that making his bed every day was an important part of his daily routine. Nevertheless, he said it was a big help to him when he was going through a period of his life that felt particularly scattered, so I figured I would give it a try too.

At first I found my mood and my morning were largely unchanged by having made my bed. I kept it up though, and after a few days, I left my room feeling unreasonably proud of this small amount of work. It's nice to start the day out by completing the first task attempted, and I really enjoy adding a little dose of neatness into day that inevitably slides into disorder.

Here is [Admiral William H. McRaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._McRaven) elaborating in a commencement speech:

...and here is Hindu priest [Dandapani](https://dandapani.org/) describing how bed making can improve your willpower:

Plus, it's never too late to start listening to your mom.
