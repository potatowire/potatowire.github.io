I’m repeating myself, but it is hard to write every day.

I want to make sure my writing fits within some sort of logical framework, so it is useful, but it is hard to be that organized. It is so hard to be brief and clear. It’s harder still to be brief, clear, and organized.

I could post less often, except I continually prove that I am all-or-nothing in everything I do. Maybe I need to change that? Maybe I am subjecting you, patient reader, to the twists and turns of my mind, when I could learn to publish less frequent, but better posts. Maybe I should write every day, but publish twice a week. Maybe the writing, as it stands now, isn’t worth it.

I don’t know.
