I think I need to remove Google Analytics from  my site. 

I don’t think it helps me to wonder how many readers I have. Plus, many of you are old skool rss users, and therefore, aren’t tracked. Many of you use content blockers in your desktop and mobile browsers, and therefore, aren’t tracked. Many of you  are in the none-of-the-above category, and don’t *want* to be tracked. 

Why have I been using Analytics, then? Because I’m needy and to know someone out there is reading my nonsense. That’s not good. 

\*sigh\* I guess I’ll try to get [better][2] by only writing for the sake of writing, then. No more stats. It’s not like they were good stats anyway.

I won’t get mad if you choose to send me an email saying you think I’m great, however. I am still needy (for now?).
