I wish I had more time. One of my pet peeves is the phrase "I don't have time for that." People say this all the time (pun intended), and they are almost always wrong.

"I think I am going to learn Spanish."
"Ugh, I wish. I don't have time for that"

Wrong.

"I read the Bible every day"
"Ugh, I wish. I don't have time for that"

Wrong.

"I've got to start going to the gym again"
"Ugh, I wish. I don't have time for that"

Wrong.

"Dad, do you want to play catch?"
"Ugh, I wish. I don't have time for that"

Wrong.

"Please empty the Atlantic Ocean using only this thimble"
"Ugh, I wish. I don't have time for that"

*Right.*

Time is a limited resource, and its value depends on how you spend it. Think about yesterday. How much time did you waste? Did you waste it on purpose? 

What would you do if you suddenly [gained complete control over your time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5YI9ahUgnk)? Would you go back to school? Change careers? Backpack across Europe? Spend more time with loved ones? Would you work more?

I wish I had more time.
