Do you have anything you're embarrassed about, but rarely have to face? For me, it's money.

I'm not terrible with money, but I'm not good with it either. I am payed a perfectly reasonable salary that I should have already turned into great wealth, but I have not. I've spent some time thinking about the root of this issue. 

There is one other relevant fact, which is likely the key: I have managed many millions of dollars at work and have done so very well.[^1] I also enjoy reading and learning about finance, economics, etc., so it's not willful ignorance.  I think the problem is that I have no detachment when I manage my own money.

When it's my own money, it's also my hopes and dreams. It's a way to make my wife happy,[^2] and it's a way to [buy shortcuts][1]. It’s a way to fix problems, and it’s a way to buy happiness.

So, in my first attempt[^3] to fix myself, I am on a personal spending freeze. I will do the hard work first, before spending money. I will form and demonstrate a new habit[^4] before spending money to make it easier.[^5] Starting tomorrow,[^6] I won't buy my lovely bride stuff on a whim.

I need to fix this money thing, and it’s time to get started. I know I'll make some mistakes, but that's okay. They'll just be datapoints in my self-improvement experiment. I’m gonna get [better][3].

[^1]:	Insert here, "if I do say so myself" and other assorted false modesty.

[^2]:	She's not materialistic, but I find great joy in buying her anniversary antique rings from estate sales (she’s a classy broad) and stretching our "budget" (the quotes reflect the level of my budgeting abilities) to put her in a house I know she'll love.

[^3]:	Okay, you got me. This isn’t the first attempt.

[^4]:	It can take anywhere between 2 and 8 months to truly create a habit.

[^5]:	For example, I have enough home gym equipment for the basics (i.e. everything I *need*), but I'm not going to buy the cool stuff I want (previously thinking it would make me more apt to [get after it][2]) until I demonstrate the habit of beginning each day with a workout.

[^6]:	I already screwed up today by buying my wife a nice travel mug she's had her eye on.
