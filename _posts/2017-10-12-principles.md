As I’ve fretted about [before][1], I really want my ideas to fit together into one cohesive piece.

Reading Ray Dalio's [_Principles_][2] has only strengthened that resolve. It is really important to me that my own thinking is clear enough that others can understand how I live and work. In other words, I want to define my own principles.

I don’t have a complete picture yet, but my thoughts and ideas have definitely coalesced around certain core principles. I would like to clarify and expand on these central points.

I plan to begin with my post on [better][3]. I didn’t know how often I would return to this concept when I first wrote that post, but now I want to expand on it. I want to make it better. 

I’m not sure when I will be done, but I am going to get started.
