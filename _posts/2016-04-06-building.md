I've had a very long day, and I can't seem to make the words flow. Instead, I'd like to share two videos that may send you down a [rabbit hole](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-rabbit-hole-rabbit-hole). There is a segment of the YouTube that is all people building stuff. A further subset of these videos isn't so much about instruction as it is about appreciating the process. I find this category to be almost meditative, and very enjoyable.

First up is one of [Adam Savage's](http://www.adamsavage.com/) [One Day Builds](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKqXxhKj-VjqKzdBYPeqQUM2No2Ps7qU3). If you only know him from [Mythbusters](http://www.adamsavage.com/tvshow.html), it won't take much Googling to reveal a lot more to like. This video was just posted, and I only meant to watch a little of it. And then it was over.

I highly recommend his [podcast](http://www.tested.com/still-untitled-the-adam-savage-project/) too.

Next up is [Jimmy DiResta](http://www.jimmydiresta.com/). I've never been able to stop one of his videos after pressing play. This one is representative, but I like them all.

If you also try your hand at building, you should definitely watch his [tips series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kyLY1xWrCI&list=PLnbHUsOu-Nfvc2bTj2FWiyzrOs_UkVxZH).

Happy Hump Day.
