I alluded to this [last week](http://with.thegra.in/tgif), but I used to tweet TGIF gifs every week, as some of you may remember. What you may *not* have known is that [Seth Brown](https://twitter.com/DrBunsen) was the one who inspired me with this little gem of a tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">TGIF<a href="http://t.co/FWDXtpwcl8">http://t.co/FWDXtpwcl8</a></p>&mdash; Seth Brown (@DrBunsen) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrBunsen/status/462366223314202624">May 2, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

If you were to follow the link in that tweet, however, you would be treated to a 404 page, which is no way to end the week. 

*This* is the correct way to end the week:

I remember seeing [a video of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfQng2kjpxI) sometime in 2013 and recall it being something of a drunken dare. I suspect the Speedo was donned whilst sober, however, so perhaps his judgment was impaired at the outset.

Enjoy your weekend.
