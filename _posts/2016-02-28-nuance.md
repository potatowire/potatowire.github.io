"The Internet is one of nuance's natural predators"

- [Mike Rugnetta](https://m.youtube.com/user/pbsideachannel) on the [You Are Not So Smart podcast, Episode 067](

I think I am going to make Sunday a day to post quotes, but I will try to make them ones you haven't already heard a thousand times. 

I think most folks of a nerdy bent already know about the [YANSS podcast](http://youarenotsosmart.com/podcast/), but if you haven't listened yet, run, don't walk, to your nearest podcatcher and get going. The episode linked above is probably a good place to start,
too, because it is the beginning of a a series of episodes on [logical fallacies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies), and who doesn't want to be able to argue better?
