Yesterday, Erik and I released the first episode of our new podcast [_Seasons of Obsession_][1]. [He introduced it][2] far better than I can, but I think of the show as a combination rough draft and director's-cut version of our writing. As the name suggests, we will also sometimes veer off in pursuit of short-lived obsessions. 

Today on this site, I am launching a new feature: podcast companion posts. Since I know how hard it is to read everything I want to on a daily basis, I'm hoping an audio version might allow more folks to follow along as I try to get [better][3]. Functionally, this will be simple: each Tuesday and Thursday I will publish new posts in audio and text form. You can read or listen online right here or 
subscribe to the feed in iTunes or your favorite podcatcher.

Without audiobooks, I could only cover a small fraction of what I want to read, and I hope the audio option here will mean some of you will listen to _With the Grain_ when you can't read it. One way or the other, I hope you stick around, and please [let me know][4] what you think.
