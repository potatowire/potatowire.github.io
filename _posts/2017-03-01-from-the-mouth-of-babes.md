I had a very helpful conversation with my 2-year-old son this morning. He was watching a surprisingly interesting episode of [*Bob the Builder*]() that I thought had some good learning material. 

"Are you learning some good stuff, buddy?"   
"No, Daddy, I love trucks!"

Besides being adorable, his response got my mental wheels turning. I am a bit obsessed with learning. I read during just about every free minute of every day. I am often consciously learning, but even with fiction or something else light, I am trying to maximize the number of quality inputs to my brain.

My son raises a good point though. [Yesterday]() I mentioned [the beginner's mind](), but there could just as easily be a corollary to this overarching mindset. Namely, this should be fun. The reason I read so much is I love reading. I'm reading far more non-fiction than I used to because that's what is most interesting to me. I'm reading [very]() [long]() biographies because I want to. I need to remember this for the inevitable time when a book just doesn't sink its hooks in to me. I can put it aside and move on to a different book. I need to be willing to read a bunch of fiction if non-fiction reading loses its allure.

This should be fun. If it isn't you're doing it wrong.
