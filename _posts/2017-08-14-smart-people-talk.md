I wrote a while back about maximizing quality inputs in order open up the [*adjacent possible*][1]. While I make no effort to curate the inputs, I love to see how they interact. A circle of sorts came together today.

I listen to a ton of podcasts from nearly every genre, and a while ago I noticed how many smart people said they read Tyler Cowen's [*Marginal Revolution*][2] blog every day, so I investigated him more fully. I read a bunch of his books and binge-listened to every episode of his podcast [*Conversations with Tyler*][3] as soon I discovered it. One of my favorite interviews was the [one with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar][4]. Fascinating.

Separately, I came across Jesse Thorne's *The Turnaround*, an interview podcast about interviews. One of my favorite interviews of his was [the one with Marc Maron][5]. I’d previously heard Maron's *WTF Pod* praised by other folks I admired, so I dug in a little here too. I’ll never be able to catch up on his back catalog[^1], but I always watch his feed for guests I’m interested in. Thus, I particularly pleased to see his most recent episode was [one with Kareem Abdul-Jabar][6].

So, what does this matter? I have no idea.  All I know is I was fascinated to be able to hear an economics professor and a comedian both interview an NBA all-star I watched play when I was a kid. Sometimes it’s just nice to hear smart people talk.
